# AmbientNoiseSensor-ESP8266-
A basic circuit using a sound sensor module along with a NODE MCU ESP8266 12E.

This project is based on the following one with changes made based on components used as well as improvements made to the overall functioning of the code (in my opinion).

The LiquidCrystal_I2C library used here is not the default one which can be downloaded in Arduino IDE as, due to some bug unknown to me, that does not allow the display to function properly. The following is used instead.
